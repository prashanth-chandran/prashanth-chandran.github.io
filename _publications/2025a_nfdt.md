**Abstract**
<p>
We address the practical problem of generating facial blendshapes and reference animations for a new 3D character in production environments where blendshape expressions and reference animations are readily available on a pre-defined template character. We propose Neural Facial Deformation Transfer (NFDT); a data-driven approach to transfer facial expressions from such a template character to new target characters given only the target’s neutral shape. To accomplish this, we first present a simple data generation strategy to automatically create a large training dataset consisting of pairs of template and target character shapes in the same expression. We then leverage this dataset through a decoder-only transformer that transfers facial expressions from the template character to a target character in high fidelity. Through quantitative evaluations and a user study, we demonstrate that NFDT surpasses the previous state-of-the-art in facial expression transfer. NFDT provides good results across varying mesh topologies, generalizes to humanoid creatures, and can save time and cost in facial animation workflows.
